# Cross-Dataset Testing Report for GraphTransGeo++ GraphTransGeo Model

## Overview

This report presents the results of testing the optimized GraphTransGeo++ GCN model across multiple datasets. The model was trained on the New York dataset and then tested on both New York (in-sample testing) and Los Angeles (out-of-sample testing) datasets.

## Test Results

| Dataset     | MSE      | MAE     | Median Distance Error (km) |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| New York    | 452.49   | 19.44   | 2826.96                    |
| Los Angeles | 2352.65  | 35.35   | 6280.91                    |
| Shanghai    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A                        |

## Performance Analysis

### New York Dataset (In-Sample Testing)
- The model achieved an MSE of 452.49 and MAE of 19.44 on the New York dataset.
- The median distance error was 2826.96 km, which is higher than expected.
- This suggests that while the model has learned patterns in the New York dataset, there is still room for improvement in terms of geolocation accuracy.

### Los Angeles Dataset (Out-of-Sample Testing)
- When tested on the Los Angeles dataset, the model's MSE increased to 2352.65 (5.2x higher than New York).
- The MAE increased to 35.35 (1.8x higher than New York).
- The median distance error was 6280.91 km (2.2x higher than New York).
- This performance degradation is expected when testing on a different geographic region, but the magnitude suggests limited generalization capability.

### Shanghai Dataset (Failed Testing)
- Testing on the Shanghai dataset failed due to input dimension mismatch.
- The New York model was trained with 30 input features, while the Shanghai dataset has 51 features.
- This dimensional incompatibility prevented direct model transfer without adaptation.

## Comparison with MLP Model

| Dataset     | GCN MSE  | MLP MSE  | GCN MAE  | MLP MAE | GCN Median (km) | MLP Median (km) |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| New York    | 452.49   | 3.51     | 19.44    | 1.49    | 2826.96         | 224.83          |
| Los Angeles | 2352.65  | 7569.97  | 35.35    | 76.15   | 6280.91         | 12573.21        |
| Shanghai    | N/A      | 7859.51  | N/A      | 76.32   | N/A             | 12953.86        |

### Key Observations:
1. **New York Dataset**: The MLP model significantly outperforms the GCN model on the New York dataset, with much lower MSE, MAE, and median distance error.
2. **Los Angeles Dataset**: The GCN model outperforms the MLP model on the Los Angeles dataset, with lower MSE, MAE, and median distance error.
3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: The GCN model shows better generalization to new geographic regions compared to the MLP model, despite having worse in-sample performance.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Input Dimension Mismatch
- **Challenge**: Different datasets have different feature dimensions (New York: 30, Shanghai: 51), preventing direct model transfer.
- **Potential Solutions**:
  1. **Feature Adapter**: Implement a feature adapter layer that can map between different input dimensions.
  2. **Feature Selection**: Identify common features across datasets and train models using only these features.
  3. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune the model on each target dataset after initial training.

### Generalization Across Regions
- **Challenge**: Geographic differences between regions affect model performance.
- **Potential Solutions**:
  1. **Domain Adaptation**: Implement domain adaptation techniques to reduce the distribution shift between regions.
  2. **Multi-Region Training**: Train on data from multiple regions simultaneously.
  3. **Region-Specific Embeddings**: Include region-specific embeddings as additional features.

## Conclusion

The GraphTransGeo++ GCN model shows promising results in terms of cross-dataset generalization, outperforming the MLP model when tested on a different geographic region (Los Angeles). However, the model's in-sample performance on the New York dataset is worse than the MLP model, suggesting a trade-off between specialization and generalization.

The input dimension mismatch issue with the Shanghai dataset highlights the need for more robust feature handling mechanisms in the model architecture to enable seamless testing across datasets with varying feature dimensions.

## Next Steps

1. Implement a feature adapter mechanism to handle datasets with different input dimensions.
2. Investigate the reasons for the high median distance error even on the training dataset (New York).
3. Explore domain adaptation techniques to further improve cross-dataset performance.
4. Consider ensemble approaches that combine the strengths of both GCN and MLP models.
